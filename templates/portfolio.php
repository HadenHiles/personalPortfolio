                            This funky looking game is one that I built for my advanced web class in college.  I used html5 canvas
                            and a framework suite called createjs to build it.  I generated my own sounds, found a soundtrack, and altered images
                            to make them my own for this game.  It was a great learning experience as there is a lot more involved with creating
                            html5 canvas javascript games than you may think. Feel free to check it out and show your friends by clicking the title
                            or image. It is actually pretty fun!

                            This website was my first Wordpress site. It was a learning curve for to introduce myself to Wordpress and how it works
                            but in the end my struggles payed off. I now have a fully functional blogging website that I use to keep track of everything
                            that I learn regarding computer science. I use it mostly for things that I learn to do with web development and design but sometimes for other topics too.
                            This blog is what I call my gateway into Wordpress and I am still grateful that I challenged myself to build it my first year of college in 2013.

                            This is a project that I completed over the course of a couple weeks for Arnott Construction Ltd.
                            In order to re-do their old website and make it look newer as well as organize their desired content I had
                            to meet with the President and CEO to discuss what their needs and desires were. Although this project was
                            meant to be a simple revamp of the old site, it turned out to be a great learning experience for making website design
                            and layout decisions, as well as some content organization using javascript with help from my dad. On the tech side I
                            used some simple javascript to create a "sticky" navigation as well as CSS media queries to make the website look good
                            on all screen sizes. As a result of my hard work, the President and CEO of Arnott Construction are very happy with
                            the end result of their new website, and I am proud to have recieved that recognition from them.

                            This site started off with an idea to have all the online games that I like in one place and then I thought
                            to myself "Why can't everyone have this?" and that is when I started to make HGame. Basically you can come to my
                            HGame website and register as a user. Once you are a user you have the ability to add your own games to the site.
                            I am currently in the process of adding features that make this process easier as well as planning to implement
                            features tailored to each user. For example each user could have a list of their favourite games, or include a way
                            for people to add their high scores of each game. Feel free to check it out by clicking the HGame title above this

                            This game is the first game that I built for my advanced web class in my 3rd term of college.
                            It is a neat twist on your usual slot machine, it combines the game of baseball with the odds
                            of a slot machine, which when you think about it, doesn't make that much sense... But hey, I
                            think I pieced it together quite nicely! Check it out by clicking the title or image and let me
